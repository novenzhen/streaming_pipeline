# streaming_pipeline

The idea of this repository is to explore real time data collection and analysis, using a "pipeline" of Kafka, Spark (and/or others), Elastic Search, LogStash, and visualization (Kibana, Grafana).
 
We want to exploring applying this pipeline to analyse data from instruments (sensor data) for quality control 
but it also can be applied to run-time performance analysis of data-intensive applications.
